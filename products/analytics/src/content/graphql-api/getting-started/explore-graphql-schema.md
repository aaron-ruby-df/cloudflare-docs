# Explore the GraphQL schema

One of the great features of a GraphQL API is that it offers "introspection"â€”you can explore the graph (by making API calls) to see the available data sets, the fields and their types, and the operations you can perform.

_GraphiQL_ uses this functionality to provide a "Documentation Explorer" that you can use to understand the schema. Click on the **Docs** link on the right-hand side and then drill down, starting with `query` and proceeding to `viewer` and then `zone`. GraphiQL also uses introspection to provide query auto-complete and syntax validation.

You can explore the schema of the Coudflare GraphQL endpoint in a GraphQL client. The examples below use the GraphiQL client.

Before you begin, configure the API endpoint and HTTP headers in the GraphQL client.

## Use the Documentation Explorer

Click **Docs** to open the **Documentation Explorer** pane.

A list of available nodes displays. The nodes in the list follow this syntax:

```
node-name: node-type-definition
```

## Find the type definition of a node

When you first open the **Documentation Explorer** pane, the **mutation** and `query` nodes display:

![Mutation and query nodes](../../static/images/docs-query.png)

In this example `query` is the name of the node, and `Query` is the type definition of the node.

## Find the fields available for a given type definition

Click on the **type definition** of a node to view the fields that it provides. The **Documentation Explorer** pane also displays descriptions of the nodes.

Click the `Query` type definition. The **Documentation Explorer** panel displays the fields that the `query` node provides. In this example, the fields are `cost` and `viewer`.

![Cost and viewer fields](../../static/images/docs-viewer.png)

## Find the arguments associated with a field

Click on the type definition of the `viewer` field to list its sub-fields. The `viewer` field provides sub-fields that allow you to query `accounts` or `zones` data:

![viewer fields](../../static/images/docs-zone-filter.png)

The `accounts` and `zones` fields take arguments to specify which data set to query.

For the `zones` node you can provide a filter of `ZoneFilter_InputObject` type. To view the fields available to filter, click **ZoneFilter_InputObject**.

To limit the amount of search results that the query returns, click the **limit** argument.

## Find the search nodes available for a zone

To view a list of the search nodes available for a zone, click on the `zones` type definition after the colon (`:`) in the `zones` field:

![Zones type definition](../../static/images/docs-zone.png)

A list of **search nodes** appears, with a brief description of their behavior and a list of valid arguments. Arguments that end with an exclamation mark (`!`) are required.

![Search nodes](../../static/images/docs-fw-data-set.png)

Refer to [Data Sets (tables)](/graphql-api/features/data-sets) for details on nomenclature and behavior of these nodes.

To view the fields that a node provides, click on its type definition. If you click on the **ZoneFirewallEventsAdaptive** type definition in the  **firewallEventsAdaptive** node, a list of fields is displayed:

![ZoneFirewallEventsAdaptive type definition](../../static/images/docs-fw-fields-list.png)
