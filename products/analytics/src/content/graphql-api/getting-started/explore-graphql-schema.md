# Explore the GraphQL schema

One of the great features of a GraphQL API is that it offers "introspection"â€”you can explore the graph (by making API calls) to see the available data sets, the fields and their types, and the operations you can perform.

[GraphiQL]([GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql#readme)) uses introspection to provide the **Documentation Explorer** so that you can visually browse the Analytics schema, including available data sets (nodes) and available fields.

This article provides an introduction to the GraphQL Documentation Explorer.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, [configure the API endpoint and HTTP headers](/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/graphql-client-headers) in the GraphQL client.

## Open the Documentation Explorer

To open the GraphiQL Documentation Explorer, click the **Docs** link in header of the response pane:

![GraphiQL Docs link](../../static/images/graphiql-docs-link.png)

A list of available objects displays. The objects in the list follow this syntax:

```
object-name: object-type-definition
```

## Find the type definition of an object

When you first open the **Documentation Explorer** pane, the `mutation` and `query` root types display:

![Mutation and query nodes](../../static/images/docs-query.png)

In this example `query` is the name of a root, and `Query` is the type definition.

## Find the fields available for a given type definition

Click on the **type definition** of a node to view the fields that it provides. The **Documentation Explorer** pane also displays descriptions of the nodes.

For example, click the **Query** type definition. The **Documentation Explorer** panel displays the fields that Query` provides. In this example, the fields are `cost` and `viewer`.

![Cost and viewer fields](../../static/images/docs-viewer.png)

## Find the arguments associated with a field

Click the type definition of the `viewer` field to list its sub-fields. The `viewer` field provides sub-fields that allow you to query `accounts` or `zones` data:

![viewer fields](../../static/images/docs-zone-filter.png)

The `accounts` and `zones` fields take arguments to specify which data set to query.

For example, the `zones` can take a filter of `ZoneFilter_InputObject` type as an argument. To view the fields available to filter, click **ZoneFilter_InputObject**.

To limit the amount of search results that the query returns, click the **limit** argument.

## Find the search nodes available for a zone

To view a list of the data sets available for a zone, click on the `zones` type definition after the colon (`:`) in the `zones` field:

![Zones type definition](../../static/images/docs-zone.png)

A list of **search nodes** displays, with a brief description of their behavior and a list of valid arguments. Arguments that end with an exclamation mark (`!`) are required.

![Search nodes](../../static/images/docs-fw-data-set.png)

Refer to [_Data Sets (tables)_](/graphql-api/features/data-sets) for details on nomenclature and behavior of these nodes.

To view the fields available for a particular data set, click on its type definition. If you click on the **ZoneFirewallEventsAdaptive** type definition in the  **firewallEventsAdaptive** node, a list of fields is displayed:

![ZoneFirewallEventsAdaptive type definition](../../static/images/docs-fw-fields-list.png)
