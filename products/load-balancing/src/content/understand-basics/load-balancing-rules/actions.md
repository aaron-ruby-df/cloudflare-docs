# Load Balancing actions

## Overview

Actions tell Cloudflare how to handle HTTP requests that have matched a Load Balancing expression.

## Supported Actions

The table below lists the actions available in Load Balancing. These actions are listed in order of precedence. If the same request matches two different rules which have the same priority, precedence determines the action to take.

Action | Description | Order of precedence
---------|----------|---------
 _Fixed response_ |  | 
 _Pool selection_ |  | 
 _Session affinity_ |  |
