# Load Balancing rules

Load Balancing rules allow you to customize the behavior of your Cloudflare [load balancer](/understand-basics/load-balancers). For example, use Load Balancing rules to select an [origin pool](/understand-basics/pools) based on the URI path of an HTTP request.

You can [create Load Balancing rules](/understand-basics/load-balancing-rules/create-rules), using the **Create Custom Rule** dialog, whenever you create or edit a load balancer in the **Traffic** app.

As with Cloudflare [Firewall Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules), each Load Balancing rule is a combination of two elements: an [expression](/understand-basics/load-balancing-rules/expressions) and an [action](/understand-basics/load-balancing-rules/actions). Expressions define the criteria for an HTTP request to trigger an actionâ€”the action tells Cloudflare what to do with that request.
